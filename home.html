    <h2>Welcome to Roastery Coffee House</h2>
    <p><strong>Roastery Coffee House Hyderabad</strong> is a benchmark in the specialty coffee and café industry in
      India. It was Hyderabad’s first tryst with specialty coffee and a dream come true for the brand’s founder,
      <strong>Nishant Sinha</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Roastery Coffee House opened its doors in Banjara Hills in 2017, creating history as the first café in the area.
      It housed the city’s first coffee roasting unit and was the only place to serve Indian specialty coffee. Within no
      time, Roastery became the “it” place to go to. Six years down the line, Roastery still continues to be the city’s
      favorite.</p>

    <p>On <strong>25th December 2024</strong>, Roastery Coffee House made history once again by opening its second
      Hyderabad outlet in <strong>Kokapet</strong>. Highlighting its legacy, the new café promises to uphold the same
      benchmark of specialty coffee and exceptional experiences.</p>

    <p>In this interim of six years, Nishant has opened six Roastery Coffee House outlets across six cities in India.
    </p>

    <p>Before Roastery, Hyderabadis (much like the rest of India) knew coffee as instant coffee or cappuccino at a café,
      or the traditional filter coffee. Home brewing was largely unheard of. In fact, except for a handful of
      well-travelled youngsters, nobody was even aware of specialty coffee.</p>

    <p>Today, the demand for freshly roasted specialty coffee amongst home brewers is at an all-time high. From zero
      home brewers to thousands of them, the Hyderabadi home brewing community is ever-increasing.</p>

    <p><strong>After six years, Roastery Coffee House now sells 50 tons of specialty coffee annually</strong>, out of
      which <strong>10 tons are purchased by home brewers</strong>.</p>
